# Pizza Palace

## Project Description
Pizza Palace is a Single Page Application designed to facilitate online pizza ordering. The first thing you'll see upon entering this SPA is a secure login portal, accompanied by a streamlined form for new users to utilize for account creation (with a confirmation email included upon completion of the form). Following successful login the user is taken to the menu, where they are greeted with an interactive set of items to build their ideal pizza-based meal. Users can view their selections in the cart, which conveniently pops out when a user clicks it's icon. When all is said and done and the User is happy with their order they can move to the checkout form asking for details to complete their order. After submitting the form the User will receive a confirmation email with their order information included inside.
